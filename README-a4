Our file system now has support for filenames that are up to 62 bytes long. Directory entry structure is a total of 64 bytes, leaving room for 2 byte inode numbers, we have 62 bytes left over for the filenames. We tested this capability by creating a "bad block file" with a longer file name (longer than 14 characters to be precise). We did this by making sure WUFS_NAMELEN and WUFS_DIRENTSIZE were increased respectively. 

Our file system also has support for files that are bigger than 9K. To store a file that requires more than nine data blocks, we instead make the last space in the data block array a singly indirect pointer to another block, which can then hold an extra 512K of data. Additionally, we changed the max number of data blocks for each file to be 8 rather than 9 to reflect the 32 bit pointers. This brings the max file size to a total of 7 + 512 = 519K.
